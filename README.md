# tic-tac-toe

##Abstract:
This application is a product of the Tic Tac Toe project assigned in Mod 1 of the Front End Software Engineering & Design program. The application allows two users to play a game of Tic Tac Toe, set up with a Bravo Vanderpump Rules theme. 

##Installation Instructions:
Tic Tac Toe works in a browser, and randomly assigns a player to start at page load. Users can choose which cast member they would like to be, with player one being Ariana and player two being Tom. Users can refresh the page after deciding which player they want to be.

Users can then take turns selecting a box on the grid, with the goal of placing their token in 3 consecutive boxes. Winning options include 3 tokens in a row placed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the board. 

If a user achieves a wining option, the board disallows further clicks, anounces the winner, and adds a win to the player's win status banner. After a brief pause (4 seconds), the player turn is assigned to the player who went second on the previous game. In the event of a draw, the board resets and the player is reassinged in the same manner.

##Context:
This project was intended to be completed individually. It was assigned in the fifth week of module 1. Instructors assigned this project roughly 1 week before the due date.

Learning Goals:
The learning goals of this project were to:
- demonstrate an understanding of DRY JavaScript and event delegation
- show understanding of the data model, DOM, and how data is displayed on the DOM
- use for loops to iterate and filter thorugh DOM elements
- implement problem solving skills to break down a large project

##Wins + Challenges:
1. A win for this project is that I created a complete Tic Tac Toe game with all requirements. I think I also implemented DRY JavaScript and followed Single Responsibility Principles. 

2. A challenge with this project was creating a data model(s). At the beginning of the project, I wasn't sure how to create a data model that would allow me to efficiently access and change data throughout building the game. This led to me editing and changing my data model frequently at the start, which subsequently created a lot of standstill as my code could take a variety of directions with logic. I learned that sometimes it can be helpful to pick one method, try it fully, and if it doesn't produce the desired outcome THEN go back. It was challenging not to write 3 sets of code, one for each data model approach. Ultimately, with the support of mentors, I found confidence in my problem solving and logic skills to pick one approach without feeling like I needed an immediate, functional backup.
